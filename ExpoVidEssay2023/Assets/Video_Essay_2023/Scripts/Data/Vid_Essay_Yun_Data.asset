  vidEssayTitle: The Interplay of Body Horror and Humour, Generating the Ambivalence
    Through Two-Dimensional Animations
  vidEssayDescription: "Body horror is a subgenre defined as the graphical violation
    of human bodies, it is opposed to the normal bodily structure (Cruz 2012). While
    humour may seem as a conflicting idea when viewing body horror depictions, the
    medium of two-dimensional animation allows more possibilities for viewers to
    perceive humour from body horror. This research will delve into the question
    of how body horror can be interplayed with humour in two dimensional animation
    as an effective tool for generating the ambivalent feelings. The methodology
    of practice-based research will be employed through this research, by examining
    the animated series \u201CThe Knot\u201D and \u201CThe Little Mishaps\u201D."
