  vidEssayTitle: Constraint-led Approach in Designing Extended Reality Experiences
    for Enhanced Immersive Empathy
  vidEssayDescription: 'As extended reality (XR) technology advances, prevailing
    XR experiences often prioritize maximizing player control and agency through
    expanded freedom. This essay diverges from the conventional approach by examining
    an artefact of the author "Drift", which employs constraints in player control
    to foster immersive empathy. Our comprehension of the interplay between constraints
    in play and immersive empathy is still emerging. This study seeks to unpack some
    insights related to the following themes: Constraints as a narrative of the play,
    and the relationship between constraints and empathy within XR. Through this
    exploration, the paper proposes a method for designing XR experiences with constraints,
    offering a foundation to inform future practices centred around empathy-driven
    design.'
