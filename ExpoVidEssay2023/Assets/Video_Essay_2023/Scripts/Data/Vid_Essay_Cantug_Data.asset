    the gaming industry to maintain cultural authenticity while delivering enjoyable
    gaming experiences. The findings of this research underscore the significance
    of folklore-based games as instruments for enhancing players' cultural awareness.
    The empirical data reveals that engagement with these games fosters a renewed
    interest in the original myths and folklore. Moreover, this research will emphasize
    their deliberate efforts to strike a harmonious balance between cultural authenticity
    and engaging gameplay. In the broader context of game studies and cultural preservation,
    this research makes a compelling case for the educational potential of folklore-based
    video games. It suggests that these games not only entertain but also serve as
    valuable resources for cross-cultural education, offering players a unique opportunity
    to explore and appreciate the rich tapestry of global heritage. As the gaming
    industry continues to evolve, this study contributes valuable insights for game
    developers, educators, and researchers alike. It highlights the importance of
    cultural sensitivity in game design and encourages further exploration of folklore-based
    narratives as a means of preserving, adapting, and sharing ancient tales with
    modern audiences.
