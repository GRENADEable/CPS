  vidEssayTitle: Recontextualising Core Values of Traditional Local Spiritual Knowledge
    with Animated Storytelling
  vidEssayDescription: This video essay explores how to transform culture-specific
    core values into an animated narrative that possesses the ability to permeate
    and be understood by globalised, multicultural communities using metaphors and
    visuals as representative language. The methods allow a more straightforward
    interpretation as the signified and the signifier share similar features, unlike
    written and spoken language which do not have any resemblance. This is especially
    effective in introducing new ideas to audience without prior knowledge and context
    of the cultural values.
