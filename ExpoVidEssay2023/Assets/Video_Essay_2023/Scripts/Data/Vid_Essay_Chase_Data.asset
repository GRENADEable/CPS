  vidEssayTitle: How can mechanics be used to support narrative play in fantasy card
    games?
  vidEssayDescription: "This video essay examines how game mechanics are used to
    support narrative play within Level UP! Heroes, a fantasy card game prototype
    developed by the author Chase Profaca. Narrative play as defined by Salen and
    Zimmerman (2003) and Dubbelman (2016) is narrative that unfolds in gameplay through
    player interpretation, meaning it doesn\u2019t explicitly exist until the player
    interprets it. Narrative play has been utilised within fantasy card games, most
    notably within card games such as Yu-Gi-Oh! The Trading Card Game (Yu-Gi-Oh)
    and Magic: The Gathering (MTG). Drawing on these works, the paper shares how
    the design of Level UP! Heroes has used game mechanics to utilise narrative play.
    It aims to contribute to an understanding of narrative play within fantasy card
    games, guiding future work by game designers in this area."
