  vidEssayTitle: Strategic Dialogue as a Game Mechanic - Moving from Branching Narratives
    to Branching Perspectives
  vidEssayDescription: "Branching narratives are a defining trait of modern interactive
    fiction, and many other narrative focused games. Their appeal lies within the
    high degree of control they give players over the path taken by the game\u2019s
    narrative, characterized by choices offered to players at certain points. The
    problem, however, is that these choices are usually presented in isolation, only
    at specific points of the narrative. So how can we, as narrative designers, provide
    players with a more nuanced experience? This video essay discusses the key elements
    of this question, while examining related work and talking about this narrative
    design approach through the lens of my project, LINK."
