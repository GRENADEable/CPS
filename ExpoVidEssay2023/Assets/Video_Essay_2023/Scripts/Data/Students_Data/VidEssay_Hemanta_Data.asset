  vidEssayTitle: 'Evolving Spirituality: Harnessing Abstract Art Elements in Hybrid
    Animation'
  vidEssayDescription: "In the thriving and constant growth of hybrid animation,
    countless research and discussions have highlighted its innovative nature to
    create a distinct visual language. Though there is an abundance and technical
    discussion and the power and flexibility this technique brings, there is a noticeable
    gap in theoretical aspects that are applied in 2D animation. Specifically, the
    emotional and spiritual aspect is influenced by traditional painterly, abstract
    styles of 2D art that have influenced hybrid animation. Wassily Kandinsky\u2019s
    theory of abstract style and its potential to evoke spiritual emotions using
    line and color has in a way influenced hybrid animation."
