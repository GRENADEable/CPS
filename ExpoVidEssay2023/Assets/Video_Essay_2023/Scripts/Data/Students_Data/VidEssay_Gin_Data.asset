  vidEssayTitle: ' Sound in Urban Play - Symphony With'
  vidEssayDescription: "Co-designer: Nicholas Leong\r\n\n\rSymphony With is an interactive
    sound installation. It is one of the games from Urban Play School,  a Future
    Play Lab project, collaborated with RMIT Creative. Symphony With involves participants
    in two distinct phases: \u2019Curiosity\u2019 and \u2018Connectivity.' It organically
    encourages players to explore patterns, collaborate, and compose a 'symphony'
    together. It bridges the gap between strangers and friends, fostering social
    interaction and connection.\n\nPhoto credit: Ashish Narwade / Nicholas Leong"
