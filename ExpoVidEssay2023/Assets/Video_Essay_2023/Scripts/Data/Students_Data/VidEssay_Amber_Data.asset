  vidEssayTitle: Revitalising Traditional Handmade Animation Practices through Hybridity
  vidEssayDescription: "In recent years, animation has seen a paroxysm of digital
    technologies being used to push cinema and storytelling further. This has led
    to a growing number of filmmakers and practitioners within the animation field
    constantly pushing boundaries with various hybrid techniques and methodologies.
    While various scholars and practitioners have explored the application of hybridity
    throughout animation over the years it remains fairly under-researched. Specifically,
    the interplay between stop motion animation and two- dimensional (2D) hand-drawn
    animation has yet to receive a great deal of attention. \r\n\r\nThis video dives
    into my work Sultan T. Sloth - a hybrid animation solution to translate literary
    works from page to screen using two traditional methods of animation, to create
    a unique artistic language. Situating this study in theories of New Materialism
    and the Philosophy of Movement, through an interconnected realm of hybridity,
    materiality, and psychological realism."
