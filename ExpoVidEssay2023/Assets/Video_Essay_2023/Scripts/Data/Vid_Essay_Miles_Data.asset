  vidEssayTitle: 'Queer History, Animated: What form of history could animation make?'
  vidEssayDescription: "This research analyses the potential of animation to be a
    site of communicating history \u2018queerly\u2019. Public culture\u2019s constructions
    of LGBTQ+ history are often built around Stonewall, and the modern way we categorise
    gender and sexuality. However, building a history in this way risks eliminating
    embodiments of gender and sexuality in the past which exist differently to these
    categories and often imposes assumptions of heteronormativity on the past. There
    have been multiple historiographical ideas which have challenged these conventions
    of telling history, but articulating these ideas into public culture requires
    a challenge to how we typically consume history - instead it must be delivered
    'queerly'. While there are many ways this translation could take place, animation
    is a medium which has already been located as a site with unique capabilities
    to articulate queer time and embodiment. The medium can bend, stretch and break
    free from the conventional reality and defies what is considered 'proper' knowledge.
    Thus, in dissecting these properties and considering the medium's relationship
    to its audience, an animated shape of queer history emerges."
