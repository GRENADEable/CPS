  vidEssayTitle: Character Environment Relationship in the Creation of Believable
    Constructed Worlds
  vidEssayDescription: "In the past, the question of engaging an audience and making
    them believe in a depicted world has mainly been discussed in terms of reaching
    hyper-realistic character performance.\r\n\r\nOther practitioners have discarded
    this character-centric approach and instead explored the capabilities of worldbuilding
    as a storytelling and immersive device in conveying truthful worlds. \r\n\r\nHowever,
    few have delved into the relationship between a character and environment as
    a method to examine questions of believability within seemingly unrealistic worlds.
    \r\n\r\nThroughout this paper, the term 'believability' refers to the quality
    of an audience to play along, emotionally interact and accept the depicted illusion."
